  - Zero-day vulnerability scanning
  - Memory forensics capabilities

- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Network traffic analysis
  - Distributed monitoring system
  - Automated incident response
  - Real-time visualization

- **Comprehensive Forensics**
  - Network packet capture and analysis
  - Memory forensics integration
  - Automated evidence collection
  - Chain of custody maintenance

## Prerequisites ϟ

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.x or higher
- Boost libraries
- OpenSSL
- nlohmann/json
- spdlog
- libcurl

## Quick Start ϟ

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0x0060/NIDS.git

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run the system
./nids
```

## Documentation ϟ

Detailed documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory:

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
- [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)

<summary>Sample Configuration</summary>

```json
{
  "threat_intelligence": {
    "feeds": [...],
    "update_interval": 3600,
    "cache_ttl": 86400
  },
  "detection_engine": {
    "sensitivity": "high",
    "ml_model_path": "models/"
  }
}
```
</details>

## Architecture ϟ

The system is built with a modular architecture:
